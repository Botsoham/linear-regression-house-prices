# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project develops a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on various features such as:  
- Area (sq. ft)  
- Number of Bedrooms  
- Number of Bathrooms  
- Number of Stories  
- Parking Availability  
- Location Features (Main Road, Guest Room, Basement, Air Conditioning, etc.)  
- Furnishing Status  

The dataset is collected from **Kaggle** and preprocessed to handle categorical variables, missing values, and scaling. The model provides accurate predictions and valuable insights into housing prices.

## 🔑 Workflow  

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Correlation heatmap  
   - Distribution plots  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Handling missing values (if any)  
   - Feature selection  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Train-Test Split  
   - Linear Regression model training  
   - Prediction on test data  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R-squared (R²) score  
   - Residual analysis  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Residual plots  
   - Actual vs Predicted house prices
