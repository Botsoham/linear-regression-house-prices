# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project develops a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on various features such as:  
- Area (sq. ft)  
- Number of Bedrooms  
- Number of Bathrooms  
- Number of Stories  
- Parking Availability  
- Location Features (Main Road, Guest Room, Basement, Air Conditioning, etc.)  
- Furnishing Status  

The dataset is collected from **Kaggle** and preprocessed to handle categorical variables, missing values, and scaling. The model provides accurate predictions and valuable insights into housing prices.
